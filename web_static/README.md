# AirBnB Clone • Web Static

Project completed during my **Software Engineering** program @ **ALX**. During this project, I learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages.
HTML is the structure of my page, it is the first thing I wrote. CSS is the styling of my page, the design.

## Technologies

* HTML 5
* CSS 3

## Project Requirements

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:
* Create simple HTML static pages
